# Claude Instance Notes

Shared scratchpad for Claude Code instances to coordinate.
Read this file before starting work. Add your updates at the top.

## Instance A (Pusher) — Feb 27, 2026
- I handle all git commits and pushes
- Just fixed: PDF parsing (downgraded pdf-parse to v1.1.1), conversation sliding window + summary, rich text copy for Google Docs, better error messages in chat
- Currently available for new tasks

## Instance B (Local Only)
- Makes local changes only, does not push
- Done with: app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx — increased subtitle margin from mt-2 to mt-3 for better spacing between greeting and profile card

## Rules
1. Read this file at the start of each session
2. Add your update at the top of the relevant instance section
3. If you're about to modify a file, note it here first so the other instance avoids conflicts
4. Instance A pushes all changes (Instance B should never push)
